Sonar2Analog
============

The code original from http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2209667

It used cheap sonar module HC-SR04 with ATtiny85 microcontroller to convert signal to PWM.

I found an ATtiny85 SOC and revised the code to fit it.

If you want to get original code, it will be found in release tag.


FYI.
